/*

Operators are special functions that are syntactically (written) differently.

Generally, operators take two parameters and return one result.

Javascript, along with most programming languages, provides 'infix' notation, which allows us
to use operators in between the two parameters we wish to work with.

This means we can write 3 + 4 rather than having to do something like the below:

function add(num1, num2) {
	
	return // add the two numbers

}

add(3, 4);
