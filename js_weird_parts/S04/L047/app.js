/*

In this example, the result of our 3 function calls on lines 19-21 are all 3.

This is again due to closures.

What happens is that buildFunctions() creates the array 'arr' and pushes the function on lines 8-10 to it, three times.

The annonymous function it is pushing references variable i. Note that variable i is defined in the for loop inside of 
buildFunctions() and is incremented by 1 each time the loop is run. 

The array is returned and then assigned to the variable fs on line 17.

On line 19-21, we invoke the annonymous functions we pushed to each index of the array.

All three look for the variable 'i' but can't find it in the current execution context, so each of them look at their outer reference
and find it as '3' in the buildFunction() execution context, because this is the last value it was set to by our 
for loop before it stopped running.
